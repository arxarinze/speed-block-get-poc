## ***Descretion used: Based On the requirements to connect to a subscription, i have used the subscription to load the last block by listening to newBlockHeaders ***

### GET /api/get-fee-estimate
***This will solve the question 1a and also include additonal metric "block fullness of last block" in percentage***

### GET /api/get-fee-estimate?option=true
***0 means last block****
***This will solve the question include 1b where option = 'n blocks' and also include additonal metrics "block fullness of last block" in percentage***

***30 blocks came in faster than 5 blocks showing similar response time between them and the delay is due to the filling of the last block when they were each called***
